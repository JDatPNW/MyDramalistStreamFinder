  On MDL you should now see another button now that is labeled "Stream Drama". (Depending on your PC, this could take a second, since it will only appear once the page ios fully loaded.)

  This will open a drop down menu that shows you the sites where you can search for the show. (It searches for the show even if it does not exist)

  Once you clo=ick on the site you want a new tab will open that will search for that show on that site. Again, it will also search for the show if it does not exist. It does save time by making it all just one click.
