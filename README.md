# MyDramalistStreamFinder
Links dynamically to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Kokowa, YouTube and Viki straight from the MDL drama page.

### Installation
You can now [Download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mdl-stream-finder/opmdpgkejhnplnbfccekmagkbnjmcmgd) the Extension from the Chrome Webstore for free.


   - [Download](https://github.com/JDatPNW/MyDramalistStreamFinder/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
   - Move the folder to the desired directory on your PC
   - Unzip the folder
   - Open the Extension Settings:
      - Either type 'chrome://extensions/' in as the URL
      - Or go to three dots in the top right -> More tools -> Extensions
   - Drag and Drop the unzipped folder into the Chrome Extension Settings Window

### Usage
  On MDL you should now see another button now that is labeled "Stream Drama". (Depending on your PC, this could take a second, since it will only appear once the page is fully loaded.)

  This will open a drop down menu that shows you the sites where you can search for the show. (It searches for the show even if it does not exist)

  Once you click on the site you want a new tab will open that will search for that show on that site. Again, it will also search for the show if it does not exist. It does save time by making it all just one click.
